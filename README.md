# react-native-sound

React Native module for playing sound clips on iOS, Android, and Windows.

'NOTE: React-native-sound does not support streaming'. See #353 for more info. Of course, we would welcome a PR if someone wants to take this on.

## Basic usage

First you'll need to add audio files to your project.

- Android: Save your sound clip files under the directory `android/app/src/main/res/raw`. Note that files in this directory must be lowercase and underscored (e.g. my_file_name.mp3) and that subdirectories are not supported by Android.
- iOS: Open Xcode and add your sound files to the project (Right-click the project and select `Add Files to [PROJECTNAME]`)

```js
// Import the react-native-sound module
var Sound = require('react-native-sound');

// Enable playback in silence mode
Sound.setCategory('Playback');

// Load the sound file 'whoosh.mp3' from the app bundle
// See notes below about preloading sounds within initialization code below.
var whoosh = new Sound('whoosh.mp3', Sound.MAIN_BUNDLE, (error) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log('failed to load the sound', error);
    return;
  }
  // loaded successfully
  console.log('duration in seconds: ' + whoosh.getDuration() + 'number of channels: ' + whoosh.getNumberOfChannels());

  // Play the sound with an onEnd callback
  whoosh.play((success) => {
    if (success) {
      console.log('successfully finished playing');
    } else {
      console.log('playback failed due to audio decoding errors');
    }
  });
});

// Reduce the volume by half
whoosh.setVolume(0.5);

// Position the sound to the full right in a stereo field
whoosh.setPan(1);

// Loop indefinitely until stop() is called
whoosh.setNumberOfLoops(-1);

// Get properties of the player instance
console.log('volume: ' + whoosh.getVolume());
console.log('pan: ' + whoosh.getPan());
console.log('loops: ' + whoosh.getNumberOfLoops());

// Seek to a specific point in seconds
whoosh.setCurrentTime(2.5);

// Get the current playback point in seconds
whoosh.getCurrentTime((seconds) => console.log('at ' + seconds));

// Pause the sound
whoosh.pause();

// Stop the sound and rewind to the beginning
whoosh.stop(() => {
  // Note: If you want to play a sound after stopping and rewinding it,
  // it is important to call play() in a callback.
  whoosh.play();
});

// Release the audio player resource
whoosh.release();
```

## Notes
- To minimize playback delay, you may want to preload a sound file without calling `play()` (e.g. `var s = new Sound(...);`) during app initialization. This also helps avoid a race condition where `play()` may be called before loading of the sound is complete, which results in no sound but no error because loading is still being processed.
- You can play multiple sound files at the same time. Under the hood, this module uses `AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient` to mix sounds on iOS.
- You may reuse a `Sound` instance for multiple playbacks.
- On iOS, the module wraps `AVAudioPlayer` that supports aac, aiff, mp3, wav etc. The full list of supported formats can be found at https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/MusicAudio/Conceptual/CoreAudioOverview/SupportedAudioFormatsMacOSX/SupportedAudioFormatsMacOSX.html
- On Android, the module wraps `android.media.MediaPlayer`. The full list of supported formats can be found at https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/media-formats.html
- On Android, the absolute path can start with '/sdcard/'. So, if you want to access a sound called "my_sound.mp3" on Downloads folder, the absolute path will be: '/sdcard/Downloads/my_sound.mp3'.
- You may chain non-getter calls, for example, `sound.setVolume(.5).setPan(.5).play()`.
