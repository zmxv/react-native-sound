## Installation

First install the npm package from your app directory:

```javascript
npm install react-native-sound --save
```

Then link it automatically using:

```javascript
react-native link react-native-sound
```

### Manual Installation on iOS

This is not necessary if you have used `react-native link`

In XCode, right click **Libraries**.
Click **Add Files to "[Your project]"**.
Navigate to **node_modules/react-native-sound**.
Add the file **RNSound.xcodeproj**.

In the *Project Navigator*, select your project.
Click the build target.
Click **Build Phases**.
Expand **Link Binary With Libraries**.
Click the plus button and add **libRNSound.a** under **Workspace**.

Drag and drop sound files into *Project Navigator* to add them to the project.  Verify that the files are packaged in the app bundle in either way:

* Select a sound file in the *Project Navigator*, tick the checkbox in the *Target Membership* list on the right.
* Alternatively, click the build target, click **Build Phases**, expand **Copy Bundle Resources**, add the file if it's not already listed.

Run your project (⌘+R).

### Manual Installation on Android

This is not necessary if you have used `react-native link`

Edit `android/settings.gradle` to declare the project directory:
```
include ':react-native-sound'
project(':react-native-sound').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-sound/android')
```

Edit `android/app/build.gradle` to declare the project dependency:
```
dependencies {
  ...
  compile project(':react-native-sound')
}
```

Edit `android/app/src/main/java/.../MainApplication.java` to register the native module:

```java
...
import com.zmxv.RNSound.RNSoundPackage; // <-- New
...

public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {
  ...
  @Override
  protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
    return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
        new MainReactPackage(),
        new RNSoundPackage() // <-- New
    );
  }
```

For older versions of React Native you need to edit `MainActivity.java` instead:

```java
...
import com.zmxv.RNSound.RNSoundPackage; // <-- New
...

public class MainActivity extends Activity implements DefaultHardwareBackBtnHandler {
  ...
    @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){
    ...
    mReactInstanceManager = ReactInstanceManager.builder()
      .setApplication(getApplication())
      ...
      .addPackage(new MainReactPackage())
      .addPackage(new RNSoundPackage()) // <-- New
      ...
  }
```

## Demo project

https://github.com/zmxv/react-native-sound-demo

## Basic usage

First you'll need to audio files to your project.

- Android: Save your sound clip files under the directory `android/app/src/main/res/raw`. Note that files in this directory must be lowercase and underscored (e.g. my_file_name.mp3) and that subdirectories are not supported by Android.
- iOS: Open Xcode and add your sound files to the project (Right-click the project and select `Add Files to [PROJECTNAME]`)

```js
// Import the react-native-sound module
var Sound = require('react-native-sound');

// Enable playback in silence mode (iOS only)
Sound.setCategory('Playback');

// Load the sound file 'whoosh.mp3' from the app bundle
// See notes below about preloading sounds within initialization code below.
var whoosh = new Sound('whoosh.mp3', Sound.MAIN_BUNDLE, (error) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log('failed to load the sound', error);
    return;
  } 
  // loaded successfully
  console.log('duration in seconds: ' + whoosh.getDuration() + 'number of channels: ' + whoosh.getNumberOfChannels());
});

// Play the sound with an onEnd callback
whoosh.play((success) => {
  if (success) {
    console.log('successfully finished playing');
  } else {
    console.log('playback failed due to audio decoding errors');
  }
});

// Reduce the volume by half
whoosh.setVolume(0.5);

// Position the sound to the full right in a stereo field
whoosh.setPan(1);

// Loop indefinitely until stop() is called
whoosh.setNumberOfLoops(-1);

// Get properties of the player instance
console.log('volume: ' + whoosh.getVolume());
console.log('pan: ' + whoosh.getPan());
console.log('loops: ' + whoosh.getNumberOfLoops());

// Seek to a specific point in seconds
whoosh.setCurrentTime(2.5);

// Get the current playback point in seconds
whoosh.getCurrentTime((seconds) => console.log('at ' + seconds));

// Pause the sound
whoosh.pause();

// Stop the sound and rewind to the beginning
whoosh.stop();

// Release the audio player resource
whoosh.release();
```

## API
### `constructor(filename, basePath, onError)`
`filename` {string} Either absolute or relative path to the sound file

`basePath` {?string} Optional base path of the file. Omit this or pass `''` if `filename` is an absolute path. Otherwise, you may use one of the predefined directories: `Sound.MAIN_BUNDLE`, `Sound.DOCUMENT`, `Sound.LIBRARY`, `Sound.CACHES`.

`onError` {?function(error, props)} Optional callback function. If the file is successfully loaded, the first parameter `error` is `null`, and `props` contains an object with two properties: `duration` (in seconds) and `numberOfChannels` (`1` for mono and `2` for stereo sound), both of which can also be accessed from the `Sound` instance object. If an initialization error is encountered (e.g. file not found), `error` will be an object containing `code`, `description`, and the stack trace.

### `isLoaded()`
Return `true` if the sound has been loaded.

### `play(onEnd)`
`onEnd` {?function(successfully)} Optinoal callback function that gets called when the playback finishes successfully or an audio decoding error interrupts it.

### `pause()`
Pause the sound.

### `stop()`
Stop the playback.

### `release()`
Release the audio player resource associated with the instance.

### `getDuration()`
Return the duration in seconds, or `-1` before the sound gets loaded.

### `getNumberOfChannels()`
Return the number of channels (`1` for mono and `2` for stereo sound), or `-1` before the sound gets loaded.

### `getVolume()`
Return the volume of the audio player (not the system-wide volume), ranging from `0.0` (silence) through `1.0` (full volume, the default).

### `setVolume(value)`
`value` {number} Set the volume, ranging from `0.0` (silence) through `1.0` (full volume).

### `getPan()`
Return the stereo pan position of the audio player (not the system-wide pan), ranging from `-1.0` (full left) through `1.0` (full right). The default value is `0.0` (center).

### `setPan(value)`
`value` {number} Set the pan, ranging from `-1.0` (full left) through `1.0` (full right).

### `getNumberOfLoops()`
Return the loop count of the audio player. The default is `0` which means to play the sound once. A positive number specifies the number of times to return to the start and play again. A negative number indicates an indefinite loop.

### `setNumberOfLoops(value)`
`value` {number} Set the loop count. `0` means to play the sound once. A positive number specifies the number of times to return to the start and play again (iOS only). A negative number indicates an indefinite loop (iOS and Android).

### `getCurrentTime(callback)`
`callback` {function(seconds, isPlaying)} Callback will receive the current playback position in seconds and whether the sound is being played.

### `setCurrentTime(value)`
`value` {number} Seek to a particular playback point in seconds.

### `setSpeed(value)`
`value` {number} Speed of the audio playback (iOS Only).

### `enableInSilenceMode(enabled)` (deprecated)
`enabled` {boolean} Whether to enable playback in silence mode (iOS only).

Use the static method `Sound.setCategory('Playback')` instead which has the same effect.

### `setCategory(value)` (deprecated)

Deprecated. Use the static method `Sound.setCategory` instead.

## Static Methods

### `Sound.setCategory(value, mixWithOthers) (iOS only)`

`value` {string} Sets AVAudioSession category, which allows playing sound in background, stop sound playback when phone is locked, etc. Parameter options: "Ambient", "SoloAmbient", "Playback", "Record", "PlayAndRecord", "AudioProcessing", "MultiRoute".

More info about each category can be found in https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AVFoundation/Reference/AVAudioSession_ClassReference/#//apple_ref/doc/constant_group/Audio_Session_Categories

`mixWithOthers` {boolean} can be set to true to force mixing with other audio sessions.

To play sound in the background, make sure to add the following to the `Info.plist` file.
```
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

## Notes
- To minimize playback delay, you may want to preload a sound file without calling `play()` (e.g. `var s = new Sound(...);`) during app initialization. This also helps avoid a race condition where `play()` may be called before loading of the sound is complete, which results in no sound but no error because loading is still being processed.
- You can play multiple sound files at the same time. Under the hood, this module uses `AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient` to mix sounds on iOS.
- You may reuse a `Sound` instance for multiple playbacks.
- On iOS, the module wraps `AVAudioPlayer` which supports aac, aiff, mp3, wav etc. The full list of supported formats can be found at https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/MultimediaPG/UsingAudio/UsingAudio.html
- On Android, the module wraps `android.media.MediaPlayer`. The full list of supported formats can be found at http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html
- You may chain non-getter calls, for example, `sound.setVolume(.5).setPan(.5).play()`.
